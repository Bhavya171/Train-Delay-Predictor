# Train-Delay-Predictor

This is a project called Train Delay Predictor in which I have tried to predict that whether the Delhi Metro train will be delayed or not depending upon some factors like weather and the station.

For this I have created a synthetic dataset because I was unable to find a dataset for the same.

The project contains some basic Data Analysis and the model.
The model is made by Neural Networks using Tensorflow and Keras.
